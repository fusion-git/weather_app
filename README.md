# Weather forcast app

This project run a simple index.html file with minimal assets like css or javascript. You can just open that file but I highly recommend you to setup a proper environment . <br /> <br /> 

In my case for this project I've used: 

## Ideal development environment 
```
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
```

### Additional extension
```
Live server 
```
